## Visualize Deleuzian Affection-Image
This is a proof of concept study visualizing Deleuzian philosophical concept. The project tried to visualize philosophical purposed by Gilles Deleuze in his (1983) book **Cinema 1: The Movement Image (Cinéma 1. L'Image-Mouvement)**

This project focuses on the concept of **Affection-image** in Chapter 6. According to Deleuze, affect is the entity that attains the close-up in Cinemas <sup>[1](#2)</sup>. He developed the ideas that filmmakers ***transform*** the close-ups of faces, i.e., the becoming of the affective farcical expressions into the affection-images <sup>[3](#3)</sup> <sup>[8](#8)</sup> <sup>[12](#12)</sup>.

If affects are entities then they should have ontology. In order to construct the ontology of the affects(affection-images), Deleuze investigated the initial presentations of the affection-images at the dawn of Cinemas. He examined the motion pictures in the beginning of the 20th century and purposed the ontological arguments for affection-images.

However, Deleuzian ontology for affects, which is derived from the transcendental empiricism that underpins the concept of becoming and affirms the positive nonbeing, complicates how difference is thought<sup>[1](#1)</sup> <sup>[7](#7)</sup> <sup>[10](#10)</sup>. It is somehow difficult to understand Deleuzian ontology of affects.

This project tried to investigates the Deleuzian ontology with the help of artificial neural networks(ANNs). We clipped images from the films hinted by Deleuze in his Cinema books and fed these images into the ANNs. The ANNs will then generate a topological map, which represents the ontology of Deleuzian cinematic affects according to the images.

The ANNs approach is inspired by the Deleuzian rhizomatic thoughts since the ANNs in a way is a rhizomatic networks.
